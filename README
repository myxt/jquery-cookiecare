Jquery CookieCare offers a solution to comply with European Union cookie laws.
Those state a user must be informed of all non-technical cookies before
placement, and must have the possibility to opt-out.

Author: Sander van den Akker (sander@myxt.nl).

I found the current popular solutions either too big and feature-packed or
lacking flexibility. I needed something simple but reusable, so I decided to
write my own script.

## Requirements:

jQuery (1.6+), http://www.jquery.com
jQuery cookie, https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie
The default html toolbar also uses Twitter Bootstrap.

## Usage:

Put the script and css in the head tag (together with jquery cookie) and init with
$.CookieCare();
See the source for commented options.

## Changelog:

0.1 initial release.
